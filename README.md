# Local file system implementation for filesystem

This is an implementation of local file access for the filesystem API.
It is mostly useful for debugging and development. The scheme used for
this implementation is called "file" for mental compatibility with web
browsers which also use this scheme.

There currently aren't any supported query flags.
